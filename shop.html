<h3 class="tt">Meth</h3>
<p class="tt"> Methamphetamine is a potent central nervous system (CNS) yrftyryryrty stimulant that is mainly used as a recreational drug and less commonly as a second-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity. Methamphetamine was discovered in 1893 and exists as two enantiomers: levo-methamphetamine and dextro-methamphetamine.Methamphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical substance, the racemic free base, which is an equal mixture of levomethamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine in their pure amine forms. It is rarely prescribed over concerns involving human neurotoxicity and potential for recreational use as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant, among other concerns, as well as the availability of safer substitute drugs with comparable treatment efficacy. Dextromethamphetamine is a stronger CNS stimulant than levomethamphetamine. </p>

<h3 class="tt">Cocaine</h3>
<p class="tt"> Cocaine (from French: cocaine, from Spanish: coca, ultimately from Quechua: k√∫ka)[13] is a tropane alkaloid and stimulant drug obtained primarily from the leaves of two coca species, Erythroxylum coca and Erythroxylum novogranatense.[14] It is most commonly used as a recreational drug and euphoriant.[15] After extraction from coca leaves, cocaine may be snorted, heated until sublimated and then inhaled, or dissolved and injected into a vein.[11] Mental effects may include an intense feeling of happiness, sexual arousal, loss of contact with reality, or agitation.[11] Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and dilated pupils.[11] High doses can result in high blood pressure or body temperature.[16] Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes.[11] </p>
